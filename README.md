# Bus Mall: Market Analysis App

Bus mall is an app that displays three random products and asks the user to pick which of the three they are more likely to purchase. After the user votes, they are presented with a different set of three random products: this process is repeated 15 times. Once the user has exhausted their 15 votes, they are presented with a buttom that will display a chart detailing their selections of which products they are most or least likely to purchase.
